#Who I am
Hello, I'm Mark Mendoza, i'm a Java Developer creating Java Web Serivces and Web Applications using technologies such as Servlets, JSP, and Spring Framework. 

I used to be a student at CSULB and learned how to create Servlets and JSPs. I was introduced to the Spring Framework at my first job, and currently work with it in my current job. 

Other things I've dabbled in are C# (ASP.NET, WPF), F#, and Clojure.
