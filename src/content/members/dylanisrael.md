#Hi, I'm Dylan C. Israel!

I'm your typical computer science major. I am interested in technology, software and computers. In my "free time" I take online courses in various programming languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, jQuery JavaScript, MySQL, HTML/CSS and more. I record these and put them on my [YouTube](https://www.YouTube.com/pizzapokerguy87) so others can watch and learn from my own mistakes. I strongly believe these fields are constantly changing and to be successful one must change with it. I also am an avid animal lover and my household has 3 cats and 1 bird.

I freelance for various web based jobs and use a skill-set that centers, but is not limited to HTML, CSS and WordPress. If you would like to know more specifically about my work history and qualifications please check out my LinkedIn. I also have coding examples in several languages on my portfolio page.

I currently freelance for myself as well as a web design firm in Rancho Santa Margarita while continuing my course work part time.
