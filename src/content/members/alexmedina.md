Hmmm... I have a cat.

`Cat.name = 'Coltrane';`

`Cat.nickname = 'Babycat';`

Sometimes I make things using [arduino](https://github.com/guitarbeard/arduino-puzzle-box).

I was also partially responsible for [this](https://github.com/guitarbeard/ArduinoGarageDoorOpener) potentially illegal code.

My girlfriend and I also made an app using the Google maps API that lets you keep multiple searches on the page so you can plan your shopping/travels better called [Irinamaps](http://www.irinamaps.com).
