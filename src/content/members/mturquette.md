Linux kernel hacker, computer architecture ethusiast, coffee drinker.

I run [BayLibre](http://baylibre.com), an embedded Linux consultancy building
consumer electronics, IoT devices and THE FUTURE. We like working close to the
bare metal. Ask me about low-level programming, hardware, building things you
can hold in your hand or anything at all about anything at all.
