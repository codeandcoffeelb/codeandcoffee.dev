Hello, everyone:

A new book club is starting up February 23rd.  It will focus on technical books, especially ones considered classical computer science texts.

The first book will be Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs second edition.

The book club will meet weekly on Sunday at 3 PM PST starting February 23rd.  The first session will be an introduction to the book club, an overview of the first book, covering the preface of the book, and deciding how much material to cover in the next session.  The second session, on March 2nd, will dive into the body of the book.

The book club will be held online in the Code && Coffee Discord server in a voice channel and will be streamed online on the Code && Coffee Twitch channel.  As always, every one is welcome to participate in their choice of text, voice, or video chat.

Once the first book is finished, the book club will collectively decide on a new book to cover with the same schedule.

If there are any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to Brody, or any of the other Code && Coffee organizers, on Discord, Meetup, or any other available communication channel.
