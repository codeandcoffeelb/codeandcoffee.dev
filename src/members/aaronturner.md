Yo! I'm Aaron Turner! I tend to spend my time developing in the frontend since I like to see what I'm doing. I enjoy development with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and I have quite a love for [Android](http://developer.android.com/index.html). I've also done a couple of [games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vOuInaCowc) using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

I love taking on random small projects that usually accomplish a single task, they usually end up buggy cause I tend to code stream of consciousness, but I also enjoy going back, maintaining, and fixing things up.

I also do a lot of other really fun things! I make some [chill tunes](https://aviscerall.bandcamp.com/album/lps-and-love-songs) as well as some [danc-y ones](https://groovygodzilla.bandcamp.com/album/godzilla-gets-friends). And, I do a lot of [rad skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OktGiy8GWg).

I'm usually out and about, doing something random. So you can contact me here:
