I first cut my teeth on programming during the days of Myspace. I learned HTML and CSS so I can make better layouts for my profile.  Along the way,
I dabbled into more and more languages like C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic, etc.  All this dabbling came to an end when I fell in love with my current
language of choice: Ruby. <br /><br />
Currently, I'm learning Ruby on Rails and hope to work at a Rails shop so I can keep dancing with the elegant and beautiful Ruby. Also, I'm in the process
of developing Intelliclash, a forum that focuses on discussing educational and intellectual topics to exercise our curious minds. In a way, I want to
make knowledge cool again! <br /><br />
Right now, I'm a student at Cal Poly Pomona majoring in Computer Science, and I'm hoping to finish as soon as I can and achieve my high school goals
of becoming a software developer.<br /><br />
