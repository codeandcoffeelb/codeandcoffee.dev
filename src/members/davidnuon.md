During the day, David Nuon is a developer that dishes out Javascript, Python and PHP. At night? He writes C and Haskell to dissect old Game Boy roms and for enhancing his enjoyment of tabletop games. David enjoys retro-computing and esoteric programming languages. If it's old or no one has heard of it, he's probably going to be in to it.

Is he the hero Long Beach deserves, but no one needs? Probably. 

He owns a pet [glider](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Glider) named Steve.
